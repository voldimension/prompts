Daily Copilot Interaction Pattern
Morning Session (2-3 hours)
Copilot Prompt Template:
"Today I'm working on [SPECIFIC_FEATURE]. Based on the existing codebase:
1. Show me the code structure I need to create
2. Generate the main implementation with proper TypeScript/Python types
3. Include comprehensive error handling
4. Add unit tests for the new functionality
5. Ensure integration with existing components"
Afternoon Session (2-3 hours)
Copilot Prompt Template:
"I've implemented [FEATURE] this morning. Now I need to:
1. Add integration tests for the new functionality
2. Fix any bugs or issues found during testing
3. Optimize performance if needed
4. Update documentation
5. Prepare for tomorrow's work on [NEXT_FEATURE]"
Weekly Review Pattern
End of Each Week
Copilot Prompt:
"Review this week's implementation for [WEEK_FOCUS]:
1. Identify any technical debt or areas for improvement
2. Suggest refactoring opportunities
3. Check test coverage and suggest additional tests
4. Verify security best practices are followed
5. Plan integration points for next week's work"
Copilot-Specific Tips
1. Context Building
Start each session:
"I'm building an Oracle database comparison platform. Here's my current project structure: [PASTE_STRUCTURE]. Today I need to work on [SPECIFIC_TASK]."
2. Incremental Development
"Based on the existing [COMPONENT_NAME], add [NEW_FEATURE] while maintaining backward compatibility and existing test coverage."
3. Testing Integration
"For every new component, generate both the implementation and comprehensive tests. Include loading states, error states, and edge cases."
4. Code Review Pattern
"Review this implementation for potential issues, performance improvements, and missing error handling: [PASTE_CODE]"
